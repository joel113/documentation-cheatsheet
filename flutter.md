#### Exclamation Mark

The exclamation mark `!` is used in dart to cast from a nullable to a non-nullable type. It should be only used if it is guaranteed that the value will never hold a null value. It should be not confused with a conditional access to a property.

### State

The `setState()` opration notifies the flutter framework that the application state has been changed and that the user interface might have to be redrawn. The framework might redraw some components in the ui tree, which causes a call to the build method of the components.
